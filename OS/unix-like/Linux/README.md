# Learning point about `vim`
## Reference: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/vim
### Configuration
> Vim's *user-specific configuration* file is located in the home directory: `~/.vimrc`

> The *global configuration* file is located at `/etc/vimrc`

The statement above is from archlinux site. It is worth to learn the term *user-specific configuration* and *global configuration* and, similarly in Ubuntu the vim's  global configuration file is `/etc/vim/vimrc.local`
