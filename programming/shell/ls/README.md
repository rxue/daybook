# `ls`
## `-T` vs `-t`
* `-T` - When printing in the long (-l) format, display complete time information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year. => works in effect if and only if `-l` option is present
* `-t` - sort by modified time
## `-R` vs `-r`
* `-R` - recursive
* `-r` - reverse the order
