# Virtual Environment
Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y21OR1OPC9A
## `venv` - built-in module for creating "virtual environment"
How to use
```
python3 -m venv env` #name env is just the conventional name of the virtual environment, it can be sth else
source env/bin/activate #activate the virutal environment in MacOS or Liniux system
pip install mariadb # example of installing mariadb dependencies

*Difference between `pip` and `pip3` inside `env/bin` directory*
`diff` these 2 files results in no output => they are exactly the same
