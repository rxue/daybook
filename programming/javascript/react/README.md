### Upshots on using the `gh-pages` *npm package*
A standard React app generated by *vite* needs to be built by means of command `npx vite build` and, by default the output is in the generated directory `dist`, which are to be deployed as static files to the server. In github page, the deployment is done by means of an automatically generated *Workflow Action* - *pages build and deployment*. This Action is generated/activated and triggered by the update in the `gh-pages` branch.

In local git repo, after running `npx vite build`, developer can make use of the `gh-pages` npm package to push the built result to the remote `gh-pages` branch in the working branch. Command to push the built result to remote `gh-pages` is `npx gh-pages -d dist`
