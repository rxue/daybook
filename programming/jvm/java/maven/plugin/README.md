# [Available Plugins](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html)
Plugins listed in the link in the title are available directly through command line. 

Take the `failsafe` plugin as an example, the `failsafe` plugin can be configured and is usually configured in the following way, https://github.com/rxue/java-from-scratch-to-advanced/commit/674d29b9b2a10e1efedd08f7a7cf0e31f98c5640 , so that the integration tests suffixed with `IT` will be executed with command `mvn clean verify`. However, integration tests can also be executed with command `mvn failsafe:integration-test verify` without any configuration in the `pom.xml`

## [`maven-shade-plugin`](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
Can Invoke *goal* directly from command line: NO

Build an [*Uber-JAR*](https://imagej.net/develop/uber-jars#:~:text=An%20uber%2DJAR%E2%80%94also%20known,needing%20any%20other%20Java%20code.) from the current project, including dependencies

NOTE! Based on trial and error experience, `maven-shade-plugin` is deeply dependent on the `maven-jar-plugin`, i.e. the main part of the *uber-JAR* is still generated by `maven-jar-plugin` => 

VARIANT of using `maven-shade-plugin`: when using `maven-shade-plugin`, the content of the major part, not the shaded part, of the  *uber-JAR* is the same as the jar generated by `maven-jar-plugin`. 
Threfore, for instance, we want to include a `main` method or some configuration only in the *uber-JAR* but exclude them in the major jar generated by `maven-jar-plugin`, it is next to impossible. In this case `maven-assembly-plugin` comes into play

## [`maven-assemly-plugin`](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/) 
Can Invoke *goal* directly from command line: NO
