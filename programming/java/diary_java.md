Don't know if this coding style is proper:
```
public class TestClass {
  public static final String CONST_1 = AnotherClass.getValueFromProperties();
}
```
Another question is about the command pattern

## *Hibernate*
### *Bootstrapping of Hibernate*
By means of `javax.persistence` API, the entry point when bootstrapping Hibernate is `EntityManagerFactory`, which can be retrieved by `Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("persistence-unit name")`. The `persistence-unit` is defined in the `main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`.

#### Properties in `persistence.xml`, Which Takes Effect When `Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("persistence-unit name")`
* `javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action` - the action for generating the database schema
* `javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source` - the SQL scripts used to import data. In the Hibernate implementation, the default value is `import.sql` in the `resources` directory. So if this property is not defined in the `persistence-unit` but the `import.sql` are defined already in the `resources` directory, the `import.sql` will be executed

## Coding Convention
### cameralCase against snake_case
Avoid use of snake_case, esp. when naming the package

#### Proof 
There is no package named with underscore in the Core Java api documentation page. Even in case of package named with multiple words, there is no underscore, either. For instance, 

* `java.beans.beancontext`
* `javax.management.modelmbean`
