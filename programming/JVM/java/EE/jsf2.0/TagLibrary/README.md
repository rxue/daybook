# `h:`
## `h:link` (20230311)
NOTE! according to the documentation, the `outcome` attribute of this `h:link` tag is the `logical outcome` used to resolve the navigation case. This means that `outcome` attribute value has to be valid, in practice an invalid `outcome` value, e.g. another jsf that does not exist, will cause no link but only a text in the frontend
