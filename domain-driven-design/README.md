### Layered Architecture

> The main structural characteristic of the *Layers* pattern is that the service of layer J are only used by layer J+1 - there are no further direct dependencies between layers. This structure can compared with a stack or even an onion. Each individual layer shields all lower layers from direct access by higher layers.
