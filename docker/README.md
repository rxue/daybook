Docker *registry* is remote and is composed of many *repositories*. One repository contains multiple images,each of which has a unique *tag*. When `pull` an image, if a tag is not given, the default is `latest`

### 20230727: don't know why my docker command disappeared in my macOS even though the docktop version exists

## Docker Image
docker image cannot be removed while a container built on base of it is running

# Docker commands
## `docker build`

## 20230924: remove all images by force
`docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)`

NOTE that remove image by force does not kill the corresponding running container

## 20240327
### list all the docker processes regardless of the status
`docker ps -a`

This can be compared with `docker ps`, which list only running container

### remove an EXITED container
`docker container rm <container-name>` or `docker rm -f <container-name>`
