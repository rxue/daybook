# 1. Introduction
## 1.3. Requirements
### 1.3.1. Relationship to *JAXB*
> JAX-WS describes the WSDL <=> Java mapping, but **data binding is delegated to JAXB**. The specification must clearly designate where JAXB rules apply to the WSDL <=> Java mapping without reproducing those rules and must describe how JAXB capabilities (e.g., the JAXB binding language) are incorporated into JAX-WS. **JAX-WS is required to be able to influence the JAXB binding**, e.g., to avoid name collisions and to be able to control schema validation on serialization and deserialization.
