## Chapter 25: Testing Persistence
### Testing That Objects can be Persisted
#### Round-Tripping Persistent Objects

**KEY TAKEAWAY** : 
The essence of *round-tripping persistent objects* : 

* trip 1: persist the object first into the database and keep the reference in one transaction
* trip 2: then retrieve it again with a new object reference in another transaction

Eventually compare these 2 objects by *ID*, i.e. the ID has to be the same

The example is the `assertReloadWithSameStateAs`, which compares the Id of the entity retrieved from the database level in one transaction (assume as A) with the Id of the original entity generated by invoking `EntityManager.persist` inside another *transaction* (assume as B)
