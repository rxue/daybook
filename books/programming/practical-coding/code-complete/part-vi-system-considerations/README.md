# Chapter 27: How Program Size Affects Construction
## 27.5 Effect of Project Size on Development Activities
### Methodology and Size
> On large projects, unconscious choices are inadequate to the task. Successful project planners choose their strategies for large projects explicitly

> Capers Jones points out that a project of 1,000 lines of code will average about 7 percent of its effort on paperwork, whereas a 100,000-lines-of-code project will average about 26 percent of its effort on paperwork (Jones 1998).

> Barry Boehm and Richard Turner caution that youâ€™ll usually do better if you start your methods small and scale up for a large project than if you start with an all-inclusive method and pare it down for a small project (Boehm and Turner 2004)

## 28.3 Estimating a Construction Schedule
### What to Do If You're Behind
#### Reduce the scope of the project
> When you plan the product initially, partition the product's capabilities into "must have", "nice to have" and "optionals".

If you fall behind, ... drop the ones that are the least important.

> Short of dropping a feature altogether, you can provide a cheaper version of the same functionality.
