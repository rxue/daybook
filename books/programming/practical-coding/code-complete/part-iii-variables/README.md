# Chapter 10: General Issues in Using Variables
## 10.3 Guidelines for Initializing Variables
Principle of Proximity: keep related actions together

> Use `final` or `constant` when possible

> Initialize a class' member data in its constructor

## 10.4 Scope
### Localize References to Variables
> Code between references to a variable is a "window of vulnerability"

=> always good idea to references to variables by keeping them close together
### Keep Variables "Live" for as Short a Time as Possible
### General Guidelines for Minimizing Scope
> Begin with most restricted visibility, and expand the variable scope only if necessary
## 10.6 Binding Time
Binding time: the time at which the variable and its value are bound together

## 10.8 Using Each Variable for Exactly One Purpose

# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names
## 11.1 Considerations of Choosing Good Names
### Computed-Value Qualifiers in Variable Names
## 11.2 Naming Specific Types of Data
### Naming `boolean` Variables
> Use positive boolean variable names
