# Part 5: Designing client/server applications
## Chapter 18. Designing client/server applications
### 18.1 Creating a persistence layer
design tip: KISS and create a lean persistence layer on top of JPA when you realize you're duplicating the same query and persistence operations
#### 18.1.3. Implementing entity DAOs (20250308)
Things to consider: 
* make choice about how callers will access the DAOs
* life cycle of a DAO instance

> Caller threads can share a DAO instance. In a multi-threaded Java EE environment, for example, the automatically injected `EntityManager` is *effectively thread-safe*, because internally it's often implemented as a *proxy* that delegates to some thread- or transaction-bound *persistence context*. Of course, if you call `setEntityManager()` on a DAO, that instance can't be shared and should only be used by one (for example, integration/unit test) thread.

> An EJB stateless session bean pool would be a good choice, and thread-safe persistence context injection is available if you annotate the concrete ItemDAOImpl as a stateless EJB component

**Thread-safety of an injected `EntityManager`**
Based on [JPA 2.0 specification](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr317/index.html) (NOTE! Before this version, JPA was part of EJB spec) > Chapter 7. Entity Managers and Persistene Contexts > 7.2. Obtaining an `EntityManager`

> An *entity manager* must not be shared among multiple concurrently executing threads, as the *entity manager* and *persistence context* are not required to be *threadsafe*. **Entity managers must only be accessed in a single-threaded manner**.

`EntityManager` is not required to be *threadsafe*, so **NOTE that access to it must be in single-threaded manner!**

So if the components, inside which `EntityManager` is used, are not *threadsafe*, it is developers' responsibility to maintain the thread-safety. A typical case is the direct use of `EntityManager` inside `Servlet` class. 


> The *EJB container* *serializes* calls to each stateful and stateless session bean instance. The injected `EntityManager` in stateless or stateful EJBs is therefore thread-safe. 

Official *reference*: [EJB 3.2 specification](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr345/index.html) > Chapter 4. Session Bean Component Contract > 4.3. Protocol Between a Session Bean Instance and its Container > 4.3.13. Serializing Session Bean Methods:

> your application server might (it doesn't have to) support thread-safe access to injected `EntityManager`s in a singleton bean or multi-threaded servlet. 

Most containers will support many instances of a session bean executing concurrently; however, each instance sees only a serialized sequence of method calls. Therefore, a stateful or stateless session bean does not have to be coded as reentrant.

=> design tip: as long as `EntityManager` is used inside a stateful/stateless EJB session bean, call of the `EntityManager` through the bean will be serialized by the EJB container and thus concurrency handling is shifted to the underlying database system without any extra synchronization code, meaning

clients do not need to write any extra synchronization code as long as `EntityManager` is injected into an EJB session bean with `PersistenceContext`

Moreover, according to the [EJB 3.2 specification](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr345/index.html) > Chapter 4. Session Bean Component Contract > 4.8. Singleton Session Bean > 4.8.5. Singleton Session Bean Concurrency

> From the clientâ€™s perspective, a singleton session bean always supports concurrent access. In general, the client of a singleton session bean does not have to concern itself with whether other clients might be accessing the singleton session bean at the same time.

=> design tip: `@Singleton` session bean can be used easily e.g. with `EntityManager` instance embedded inside without any extra synchronization code

NOTE! Before this version, JPA was part of EJB spec
Important reference: https://developer.jboss.org/thread/280437
The Java EEE spec of JPA about `@PersistenceContext EntityManager em`: 

> only be accessed in a single-threaded manner

This implies that it can't be injected into inherently multi-threaded components such as EJBs, singleton beans, and servlets

> If in doubt, inject the thread-safe `EntityManagerFactory`, and then create and close your own *application-managed* `EntityManager` in your component's service methods
practical tips:

* EJB spec requires that the EJB container serializes calls to each *stateful* and *stateless* session bean instance => injected `EntityManager` in `@Stateful` or `@stateless` EJB is therefore thread-safe
DAO classes are *stateless* without considering the `EntityManager` member. But in a multi-threaded Java EE environment, **automatically injected** `EntityManager` is *effectively thread-safe*, because internally it is often implemented as a proxy that delegates to some thread- or transaction-bound on a DAO. On the other hand, if the `EntityManager` is passed through setter of DAO, the `EntityManager` cannot be shared around!

When using EJB stateless session bean through injection, the persistence context injection is effectively thread-safe since that is managed by EJB container
