> A. Write a method that takes a List of elements and returns a new List containing the same elements in the same order with the second and subsequent occurrences of any duplicate elements removed. For example, if you pass in a list containing "spam" , "sausage" , "spam" , "spam" , "bacon" , "spam" , "tomato" , and "spam" , youâ€™ll get back a new list containing "spam", "sausage", "bacon", and "tomato"

Hint: 
* ordered set - `LinkedHashSet`
* constructor on `ArrayList` - `ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)`
