### Linux Namespaces
#### THE LINUX CGROUP SUBSYSTEM
> The Linux *cgroup* subsystem, together with the namespace subsystem, are the basis of lightweight process virtualization, and as such they form the basis of Linux containers; almost every Linux containers project nowadays (such as Docker, LXC, Kubernetes, and others) is based on both of them.

# Chapter 14: Virtual Machines
## Docker
> ...Docker provides a simpler and more standardized way to run containers compared to earlier version of containers. The Docker container also runs in Linux. But Docker is not the only way to run containers. Linux Containers (LXC) is another way to run containers. Both LXC and Docker have roots in Linux. One of the reasons the Docker container is more popular compared to competing containers such as LXC is its ability to load a container image on a host operating system in a simple and quick manner. Docker containers are stored in the cloud as images and called upon for execution by users when needed in a simple way.
