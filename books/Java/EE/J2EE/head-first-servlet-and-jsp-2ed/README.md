# Chapter 4: Being a Servlet: request and response

## Servlet Initialization and Threads
![One servlet instance corresponds to multiple threads](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3033388/225286901-b545b01b-7762-4b13-9418-a5af11ed9da6.png)

> one servlet per request. The container doesn't care who makes the request - every incoming request means a new thread thread/stack

page 101

## A Servlet's REAL job is to handle *GET* and *POST* requests
> CONNECT says to connect for the purpose of tunneling
### The difference between *GET* and *POST*
> *POST* has a body. That's the key. Both *GET* and *POST* can send parameters, but with *GET*, the parameter data is limited to what you can stuff into the request line.

![GET VS POST](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3033388/230796557-4dbacca4-f481-45b0-91c5-ede970ac4687.png)

page 110

> Besides size, security and bookmarking, there is another crucial difference between the GET and POST - the way they are supposed to be used. GET is meant to be used for getting things. ... the point is - you are not making any changes on the server! *POST* is meant to be used for sending data to be processed. ... when you think of *POST*, think: update. Think: use the data from the *POST* body to *change something on the server*

page 111

## Sending and using parameter(s)
> Q: Why would I ever want to get an `InputStream` from the request?

> A: With a *GET* request, there is nothing but the request header info. In other words, there is no body to care about. BUT... with an HTTP POST, there is a *body* info. Most of the time, all you care about from the body is sucking out the parameter values using `request.getParameter()` but those values might be large. It is also possible to create a servlet that processes a computer-driven request in which the body of the request holds textual or binary content to be processed. In this case you can use `getReader` or `getInputStream` methods. These streams will only contain the *body* of the http request and not the header.

page 123


## So that's the Requests... let's see the *Response*

> The `getResourceAsStream()` requires you to start with forward slash `/`, which represent the root of your web app.

`response.setContentType("application/jar")`

> when we say *content type* we mean the same thing as *MIME type*. Content Type is an http header that must be included in the HTTP response.

Comment MIME types

 * `text/html`
 * `application/pdf`
 * `video/quicktime`
 * `application/java`
 * `image/jpeg`
 * `application/jar`
 * `application/octet-stream`
 * `application/x-zip`

## Servlet Redirect VS Dispatcher

On page 137:
> if you look up `sendRedirect` in the API, you will see that it throws an `IllgelStateException` if you try to invoke it after the response has already been *committed*

> you can't write to response and then send to redirect


## Review: Servlet lifecyle and API
* The `init()` method gives servlet access to the `ServletConfig` and `ServletContext` objects, which the servlet needs to get information about the servlet configuration and the web app

# Chapter 7. Being a JSP: using JSP
## Create a simple JSP using "out" and a page *directive*
> The Container takes what you've written in your JSP, *translates* it into a servlet class source (.java) file, then *compiles* that into a Java servlet class. After that it's just servlets all the way down, ..In other words, the Container loads the servlet class, instantiates and initializes it, makes a separate thread for eash request, and calls the servlet's ``service()` method. 

page 283

> A *directive* is a way for you to give special instructions to the Container at page translation time. 

example of *page directive*

`<%@ page import="foo.*" %>`

## Time to see a JSPgenerated servlet
API			| *Implicit Object*
------------------------|------------------------
`JspWriter`		| `out`
`HttpServletRequest`	| `request`
`HttpServletResponse`	| `response`
`HttpServletSession`	| `session`
`ServletContext`	| `application`
`ServletConfig`		| `config`
`Throwable`		| `exception`
`PageContext`		| `pageContext`
`Object`		| `object`

### Attribute in a JSP
Scope		| In a servlet						| In a JSP (using *implicit objects*)
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------
Application	| `getServletContext().setAttribute("foo", barObj)`	| `application.setAttribute("foo", barObj)`
Request		| `request.setAttribute("foo", barObj)`			| `request.setAttribute("foo", barObj)`
Session		| `getSession().setAttribute("foo", barObj)`		| `sesion.setAttribute("foo", barObj)`

## *EL* functions and handling "null"
### And a few other *EL* operators
The following operators does not have correspondig literals:

Arithmetic Operators
* `+` : note that this cannot be used in string concatenation
* `-`
* `*`
Arithematic Operators with corresponding literal:

Operator  | Literal | Note
----------|---------|------- 
`/`       | `div`   |Â you can divide by ZERO, and get INFINITY
`%`       | `mod`   | remainder operator against ZERO causes exception

Logical Operators with corresponding literal

Operator  | Literal | Note
`&&`      | `and`   | ...
`||`      | `or`    | ...
`!`       | `not`   | ...


One operator is not supported in EL, i.e. `&`

# Chapter 11: Deploying your web app: web app deploymet
## Key deployment task, what goes where
> Tag files (.tag) must be inside "WEB-INF/tags" or a sub-directory

page 608

> ...a WAR file, which stands for Web ARchive. And if that sounds suspiciously like a JAR, that's because a WAR is a JAR. A JAR with .war extension instead of .jar

page 611

## WAR files

## How servlet mapping REALLY works
### Servlet mapping can be "fake"
> EXACT match: must begin with a slash

`<url-pattern>/beer/*</url-pattern>`

> DIRECTORY match: must begin with a slash, always ends with an asterisk

`<url-pattern>*.do</url-pattern>`

> EXTENSION match: MUST begin with an asterisk (never a slash), after the asterisk, it must have a dot extension (.do, .jsp etc.)

Reference above is on page 618

### Key rules about servlet mappings
> 1) The Container looks for matches in the order shown on the opposite pages. In other words, it looks *first* for an *exact match*. If it can't find an exact match, it looks for a *directory match*. If it can't find a directory match, it looks for an extension match.

> 2) If a request matches more than one directory `<url-pattern>`, the container choose the longest mapping. In other words, a request for `/foo/bar/myStuff.do` will map to the `<url-pattern>/foo/bar/*` even though it also matches `<url-pattern>/foo/*`. The most specific match always wins.

Reference above is on page 619

```
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>Two</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>foo.DeployTestTwo</servlet-class>
</servlet> 
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>Two</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>fooStuff/bar</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>Four</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>foo.DeployTestFour</servlet-class>
</servlet> 
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>Four</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>fooStuff/bar/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```
`http://localhost:8080/test/fooStuff/bar/` maps to `Four`
`http://localhost:8080/test/fooStuff/bar` maps to `Two`

 
Reference above is on page 621

## Configuring servlet initialization in the DD
> If you have multiple servlets that you want preloaded, and you want to control the order in which they're initialized, the value of `<load-on-startup>` determines the order!

> Any number (load-on-startup) greater than zero mean "initialize the servlet at deployment or server startup time rather than waiting for the first request"

> ...what if there is more than one servlet with a load-on-startup of 4? The container loads the servlets with the same value in the order in which servlets are declared in the DD

Reference above is on page 628

# Chapter 12. Keep it secret, keep it safe: web app security
## Authentication revisited
> For a J2EE container, authentication comes down to this: ask for a user name and password, then verify that they match

### The 4 authentication types
#### use the browser's standard pop-up form for inputting the name and password
* BASIC
* DIGEST
* CLIENT-CERT
* FORM

# Chapter 13. The Power of Filters: wrappers and filters
## Exam Objectives
### Fun things to do with filters
#### Request filters can
* perform security checks
* reformat request headers and bodies
* audit or log requests

#### Response filters can
* compress the response stream
* append or alter the response stream
* create a different response altogether

> There is no such thing as a `RequestFilter` or `ResponseFilter` interface - it's just `Filter`. When we talk about a request filter or a response filter, we are talking only about how you use the filter, not the actual `Filter` interface

page 704

### Filters are modular, and configurable in the DD

> The DD controls the order in which the filters run

page 705

## A filter's lifecycle
> ...someone needs to know the order, and that someone is the `FilterChain`, driven by the filter elements you specified in the DD.

> ...`FilterChain` can invoke EITHER a Filter or a Servlet, depending on whether it's the end of the chain

page 708
## Declaring and ordering filters

Rules for `<filter-mapping>`

* The `<filter-name>` is mandatory and it is used to link to the correct `<filter>` element
* Either the `<url-pattern>` or the `<servlet-name>` element is mandatory
* the `<url-pattern>` element defines which web app resources will use this filter 
* the `<servlet-name>` element defines which single web resource will use this filter 

### Container's rule for ordering filters:

<blockquote>

When more than one filters is mapped a given resource, the container uses the following rules:

1. All filters with URL patterns are located first...Filters with matching URL patterns are placed in the chain in the order in which they are declared in the DD
2. Once all filters with matching URLs in the chain, the container does the thing with filters that have matching `<servlet-name>` in the DD

</blockquote>

page 710

### As of version 2.4, filters can be applied to request dispatchers
... what about resources requested from a *forward* or *include*, *requestdispatch* and/or the error handling? Servlet 2.4 comes to the rescue

* you can have from 0 to 4 `dispatcher` elements
* a `REQUEST` value activate the filter for client request. If no `dispatcher` element is present, `REQUEST` is the default

# Chapter 14: Enterpise Design Patterns: patterns and struts
## YES! It's *Structs* (and *Front Controller*) in a nutshell
> The basic idea of *Front Controller* is that a single component, usually a servlet but possibly a JSP, acts as a single control point for the *presentation* tier of a web application. With the Front Contoller pattern, all of the app's requests go through a single controller, which handles dispatching the request to the appropriate places.
