# 29 Building RESTful Web Services with JAX-RS
## [What are RESTful Web Services?](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxrs001.htm)

> REST is an *architectual style* of client-server application centered around the transfer of representations of resources through requests and responses. In the *REST* architectual style, data and *functionality* are considered *resources* and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the web.

Simple, lightweight and fast are based on the following principles:

* Resource Identification through URI
* Uniform interface
* self-descriptive messages
* ~~Stateful interactions through links~~: Every interaction with a resource is stateless; that is, **request messages are self-contained.** ... State can be embedded in response messages to point to valid future states of the interaction.
