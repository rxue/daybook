states of vertices
 * white - initial
 * gray - *discovered* . *Queue* contains all the gray vertices
 * black - turned from *gray* to *black* . all edges of the gray vertex are exploited

Important explanation on the peudo-code
 * `s` - the source vertex, i.e. the *root*
 * `v.d` - the distance from `s` to vertex `v`
