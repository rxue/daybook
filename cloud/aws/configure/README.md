# `aws configure` (20230115)
According to my current understanding, it generates `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`. But I have no understanding on `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secred_access_key` in `~/.aws/credentials`. Logically there should be the corresponding `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the AWS Management web console, isn't it?
